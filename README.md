# Stratagem v.2.0.0 - A Lightweight animation library

Stratagem is a simple, lightweight animation library that consists of mixins that are designed to be easy to use and simple.
The library consists of many animations, but none will be printed unless you use them. No duplicate code, use what you want and leave the rest.

Stratagem uses SCSS syntax.

## Installation

Install using Bower

```
bower install stratagem
```

In your main import file (main.scss perhaps?) before importing your variables, helpers etc.
```
@import {filepath}/stratagem;
```

So your main import file should look something like this.
```
@import {filepath}/stratagem;

// Your other Scss code here

```
